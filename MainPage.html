<h2 id="center" >About Books N' Booze</h2>

<p>Welcome to my corner of the world and my little space on the net.  Here you will get exposed to my top
 Books and Booze picks.  When I was thinking of what to talk about besides my kids my two 
favorite things to do do came to mind.  Books and Booze!  First I thought I would do just booze, but
after a few drinks one night I had an epiphany "Books N' Booze!" Well, why not?! So here we find
ourselves, me telling you my favorite books along with my favorite booze!</p>
<p>We will first jump into my liquor cabinet and I will share with you what I think is the best
in some of the booze catagories.  I have my vodka picks for you to gander and encourage you to 
include your thoughts on my picks and feel free to suggest your own favorites as I am open to
trying anything at least once.  I even have some bacon flavored vodka along with some Smoked Salmon
vodka from Alaska.  So please share your experiences!</p>

 <h3 id="center" >First Lesson Learned About Booze...</h3>
 <p>"Just because its high priced and on the top shelf doesn't mean it's the 
 best of the best."</p>

</div>

<hr/>

<p>Next we will check out my book case and I will share with you some of my favorite authors and books.
As with the booze sections I strongly encourage you to share what you think of the books and or authors as
well as share your favorites if its not listed.  Make sure that you tell us why you think your pick is a good
read and I will most likely pick it up and give it a try.</p>

<p> So to escape my reality I really tend to gravitate towards the sci-fi/fantasy section of 
 the book store.  My standard for a good book is a healthy dose of violence, monsters and 
 sex.  I am always in the market for new authors and have been pleasantly surprised by 
 some that I would have passed up if it wasn't for someone suggesting them.   Because of 
 this I have found some in the romance section that I would never of given a second 
 thought.</p>

 <h2 id="center" >About Me!</h2>
 <p>Well as you already know I am in and from the Pacific Northwest, home of the microbrew beers and
 where distilled spirits are becoming popular and are very good.  I worked in a liquor store for three
 years and have tried and owned more booze now than I have in my entire life!  I can say, it was the
 one job I had that I LOVED to bring my work home with me. <br/>
 <br/>
 I haven't outgrown the 'why' phase and went on a quest to find out why and how a lot of the different
 spirits are made.  So here I will share the knowledge that I gleened from various sources and my
 own personal experiences in trying all the different boozes out there.
 <br/>
 My one addiction that is probably the best kind is of books!  Before kids I use to read a novel a day,
 but now three kids, school and a full time job later I am lucky to get three books a week done.  My ideal
 business to own would be a book store that sold new and used books along with a good bottle of booze to
 enjoy your book to.  Of course I would call it Books N' Booze!
